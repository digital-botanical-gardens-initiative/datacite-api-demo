# DataCite Rest API Demo Notebook

This repository contains a notebook which demos some of the functionality of the DataCite Rest API using Python. It's based on the DataCite Rest API support docs: https://support.datacite.org/docs/api

## How-to
To run the code in the [demo notebook](DataCiteRestAPI-test.ipynb), just open it in Jupyter / JupyterLab with a reasonably recent Python kernel (tested with Python 3.11.8). The tested versions for the required packages are:
- requests==2.32.3
- json5==0.9.25
